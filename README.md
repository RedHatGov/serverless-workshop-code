# OpenShift Serverless Workshop - Code
This repo contains the source code used in a workshop on OpenShift Serverless (Knative). It is organized as a set of subfolders. Each subfolder containing a microservice, some code functions, scripts, etc. We try to follow a file naming convention or provide a comment header so that it's clear which lab the code corresponds with.

For reference the workshop labs using this code [can be found here](https://github.com/RedHatGov/serverless-workshop-labguides/).
