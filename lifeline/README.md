# Lifeline
This is the code for a mobile app to aid in emergency response. It allows a user to quickly get their exact location and share it. It also has native hooks to work with the full system of [erdemo.io](erdemo.io) and interact/share data with that system.

Here's what it looks like:

## Running the App
It's a React based webapp that's meant to be deployed as a PWA (progressive web app) - basically so it functions like a mobile app that doesn't need to be installed.

## How to run it?
You can run it just like you typically run a react app - webpack it and get it to the user's web browser. But if you want to run it on OpenShift (like we do), the instructions are below.

Use the below command for a quick and dirty way to get it running in your cluster:
```oc new-app nodeshift/ubi8-s2i-web-app:latest~https://github.com/RedHatGov/serverless-workshop-code.git --name=lifeline --context-dir=lifeline```


### Running notes
* for geo-location to work you have to serve the app via https
* for geo-location to work on mobile, settings must not be actively denying GPS access
* to set/change env vars for your common/dev/prod setups use the `.env` files

## Dev/Test/Debug
### Develop with on OpenShift using odo
It's all in the devfile.yaml. If you have [odo installed](https://odo.dev/), just login to your cluster via CLI and run:
> `odo push`

And you push anytime you update code and want to send the changes to the cluster. Everything will very quickly update and the webapp automatically refreshes.

### Develop locally
This is just the standard Node.js/React model - use npm and yarn. [Full details here](./README-reactapp.md)

Clone this repo (optionally fork it first)
